# hackypi-handout
This repository contains context information to the security challenges from https://github.com/nimarty/hackypi/.

# Structure
For each security-challenge there should be a folder with the same name in this repository. E.g. chatty-charly, or relaxed-rachel.
If a challenges requires some precompiled binaries to run under linux, they should be placed together with documentation in the subdirectory.
